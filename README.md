## 🧬 Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies multiple machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**, based on diagnostic features from a breast cancer dataset.

It includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Visualization  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Comparison of model performance
