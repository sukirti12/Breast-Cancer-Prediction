ðŸ§¬ Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning.
This project applies multiple machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features from a breast cancer dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, training, evaluation, and comparison of model performance.
Dataset: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle - "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data"
Technologies Used : 
pandas â€“ For data loading and manipulation.
scikit-learn â€“ For data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
matplotlib â€“ For plotting evaluation metrics.
seaborn â€“ For heatmaps and distribution plots.
Classification Models Used:
Logistic Regression
Gaussian Naive Bayes
XGBoost Classifier
Results:
Model | Accuracy
Logistic Regression | 98.2%
Gaussian Naive Bayes | 94.0%
XGBoost Classifier | 97.6%
